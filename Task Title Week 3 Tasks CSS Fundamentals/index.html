    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
      I am Pelumi Olawole, a Cohort II member of I4G x Zuri Training,
      undertaking Frontend and Python training. I am also a Full Stack Engineer
      in training at Holberton School through the ALX SE program. In Nigeria, I

      'professional' content writer. I am a graduate of the Federal University
      of Technology, and my course of study was Mathematics(Statistics Option.)
      I am also Pursuing an MBA at the moment.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
      üë®‚Äçüíª I am really enthusiastic about creating solutions through Tech. In
      2022, I'm learning HTML, CSS, Modern Javascript, React/Redux, Node.js,
      Redis, MySQL/MongoDB and others. I started out a career in writing, then
      development coaching, and later on moved to establish myself as a business
      consultant before deciding to transition into Tech.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies & Priorities</h3>
    <p>
      ‚è´ Outside the world of Tech, I enjoy doing influecing, working wwith
      young leaders to help them devlop and grow into a version of themselves
      that can attain perosnal mastery and ultimately personal success - I have
      several programs and platfroms through which I achieve this; my coahing
      programs, bootcamps, and podcast, and other resources. I also am
      passionate about curating relevant conversations that expose young people
      to opportunities across different domains and how to leverage these
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      üìö I am avid reader and love pursuing and consuming the right knowledge in
      all its forms focused on personal development, perosnal mastery,
      philosophy, psychology, & financial literacy. My favorite books are Today
      Matters by John C. Maxwell in the genre of personal development, 5am Club
      by Robin Sharma on perosnal mastery and productivity, and 12 Rules For
      Life by Jordan Peterson on the philosophies and principles that balance
      chaos with order and vice-versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚úàÔ∏è I love traveling and plan to visit all 193 countries in the world in my
      lifetime.
