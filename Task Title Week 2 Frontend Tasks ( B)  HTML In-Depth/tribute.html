<p>
    <small>
    Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a clinical psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.

He spent fifteen years writing Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999; released in June 2018 as a now bestselling author-read audiobook).

Dr. Peterson also penned the popular global bestsellers Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life & 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, both translated into some 50 languages. The latter book has sold more than five million copies; the former, released in mid 2021, 750,000.

He’s been a dishwasher, short-order cook, beekeeper, tow-truck driver, gas jockey, bartender, oil derrick bit re-tipper, plywood mill laborer and railway line worker. He’s taught mythology to physicians, lawyers, and businessmen; worked with Jim Balsillie, former CEO of Blackberry’s Research in Motion, on Resilient People, Resilient Planet, the report of the UN Secretary General’s High Level Panel on Global Sustainability; helped his clinical clients manage the triumphs and catastrophes of life; served as an advisor to senior partners of major Canadian law firms; penned the forward for the 50th anniversary edition of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago; lectured to university audiences all around the English-speaking world (see Harvard 2017, Cambridge (2018, 2021, 2021 TBA) and Oxford (2018, 2021 TBA); identified thousands of promising entrepreneurs, with the The Founder Institute in 60 different countries; spoke to sold-out audiences across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in the course of one of the most-well attended book tours ever mounted; and is currently mounting the 2022-23 Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life book tour on a similar scale (Tickets available here).

With his students and colleagues, Dr. Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers  advancing the modern understanding of alcoholism, antisocial behavior, play, emotion, creativity, competence and personality.  He was nominated for five consecutive years as one of Ontario’s Best University Lecturers, and was one of only three profs rated as “life changing” in the U of T’s underground student handbook of course ratings.

        Dr. Peterson’s classroom lectures on mythology and the psychology of religion, based on <strong>Maps of Meaning</strong> (2016 version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQAGbKJNDrRa6GNL0iL4KoOj">here</a>), were turned into a popular <a href="http://tvo.org/archive-programs/maps-of-meaning">13-part TV series</a> v on Canadian public television’s TVO. Malcolm Gladwell discussed psychology with him while researching his books; Norman Doidge, author of The Brain that Changes Itself, wrote the forward to 12 Rules; and bestselling thriller writer Gregg Hurwitz employed several of his “valuable things” as a plot feature in his #1 international bestseller, Orphan X.

With his colleagues, Dr. Daniel M. Higgins and Dr. Robert O. Pihl, Dr. Peterson has also produced two online programs to help people understand themselves better and to improve their psychological and practical functioning. The most recent of these, UnderstandMyself, provides its users with detailed information about their personalities, based on work he published with his students here. Tens of thousands of people now know themselves better, as a consequence of completing this 15-minute program. His original self-analysis program, the Self Authoring Suite, (featured in O: The Oprah Magazine, CBC radio, and NPR’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives">national website</a>), has helped over 200,000 people resolve the problems of their past, rectify their personality faults and enhance their virtues, and radically improve their future.
